The rally starts at 5 p.m., and doors open five hours earlier to attendees who secured tickets on a first-come, first-serve basis. People can only register for two. Details here.In addition to his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, some of the speakers for the Sunday rally include: Speaker Mike Johnson, Elon Musk, Rudy Giuliani and former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.The NYPD is preparing for protesters outside of MSG during the former president’s rally. “Regarding any demonstration at the event, as always, the NYPD will protect everyone’s right to peacefully protest but we will never tolerate any violence, property damage, or any criminal activity whatsoever,” interim NYPD Commissioner Thomas Donlon said. Ahead of the rally, the NYPD said they were not aware of any credible threats to the former president or New York City. “As you all know, this is a very elevated threat environment, generally,” Rebecca Weiner, the deputy commissioner of the NYPD’s counterterrorism bureau, said. “The former president had two attempted assassinations against him over the last three months,” she said. “We’re applying a lot of resources to this, not just because of the hypothetical what-ifs, but because of everything we’re seeing unfold across the country and around the world. And that’s why we’re going to be well prepared for tomorrow.Officials warned New Yorkers not attending the rally to avoid the area, not due to any potential threat, but because of the traffic impacts, which are expected to be significant. Adams and Donlon advised people to take public transit if possible. Police officers and MTA workers will be on hand at the nearby subway stations to help guide people. There will be a handful of street closures surrounding the Garden that people should be aware of:33rd Street between 6th Avenue & 8th Avenue 32nd Street between 6th Avenue & 7th Avenue 31st Street between 6th Avenue & 8th Avenue 30th Street between 6th Avenue & 8th Avenue 7th Avenue will be closed to pedestrians from 34th to 29th Street","duplicate":false,"image_url":"https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2024/10/trump-msg-1.png?fit=1200%2C675&quality=85&strip=all","keywords":["post"],"language":"english","link":"https://www.nbcnewyork.com/decision-2024/donald-trump-msg-rally-sunday-protests/5925874/","pubDate":"2024-10-26 16:57:57","pubDateTZ":"UTC","sentiment":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","sentiment_stats":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","source_icon":"https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons/nbcnewyork.png","source_id":"nbcnewyork","source_name":"Nbc 4 New York","source_priority":8742,"source_url":"https://www.nbcnewyork.com","title":"NYPD prepared for protests outside Trump rally at Madison Square Garden","video_url":null},{"ai_org":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_region":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS","ai_tag":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS","article_id":"0778a39026cb8af942c37b6d1474f06c","category":["top"],"content":"ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS","country":["united states of america"],"creator":["By CHRISTINA A.
